### ReefPi Addons
This package contains addon scripts for my personal build using a reef pi controller. This is needed to automate more complicated tasks not possible through the web interface. Will not work for all hardware configurations.

* [Reef Pi Github](https://github.com/reef-pi/reef-pi)
* [Reef Pi web API docs](https://reef-pi.github.io/api.html)

Assumed hardware setup:
* 2 water presence sensors
* 1 DS18B20 temperature probe
* ITTT controllable smart power strip to control:
  * small pump for auto top off (ATO)
  * heater
* Potential for other addon hardware like PH probe in the future
